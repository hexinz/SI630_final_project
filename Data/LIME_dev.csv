The Globe tries to make the casual reader think that Canadians are so disturbed by Trump that they’re willing to give up their standard of living in order to show their opposition to his policies.

They advocate for constitutionally granted rights, and as soon as people take advantage of them, they describe them as ""stupid"" and ""clueless"" when in fact Bryn Mawr and Haverford are some of the most competitive colleges in the nation. This probably comes from a place of jealousy and oppression as miss Flowers has most likely never truly felt that her worthiness as a woman was enough, and therefore feels the need to publish snarky, degrading, and scathing articles about something she doesn't and never will understand to fit in with the patriarchal alt-right who believes in nothing more than making memes out of people who stand for what they believe .",1
